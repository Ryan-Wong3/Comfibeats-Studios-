Periodic Table:
Elements organized by properties.
Each has a unique symbol.
Periods: Rows represent shells.
Groups: Columns with similarities.

Atomic Structure:
Protons: Positive in nucleus.
Neutrons: Neutral in nucleus.
Electrons: Orbit nucleus.
Atomic number: Protons count.

Valence Electrons:
Outermost energy level.
Determine reactivity.
Same group: Same count.

Chemical Bonding:
Ionic Bond: Electron transfer.
Covalent Bond: Electron sharing.
Metallic Bond: Electron sea.

Stoichiometry:
Mole Concept: Avogadro's number.
Molar Mass: Grams per mole.
Stoichiometric Calcs: 
Relate moles, mass.
Balanced Equations: Equal atoms.

Limiting Reactant:
Determines max product.
Fully consumed.
Excess reactants remain.


Methodology: 
1. Draw a line 
2. at the bottom of paper 
3. Using food coloring,
mark a spot 
4. Pour 20mL 28% 
isopropyl alcohol 
5. Dip paper into beaker 
6. Wait for 10 minutes 
7. Remove chromatography strip 
8. Lie sample next to ruler
9. Measure distance 
solvent reached 
& distance food coloring reached 
10. Repeats steps 3 - 7 with:
3:1 isopropyl alcohol to water
1:1 isopropyl alcohol to water
1:3 isopropyl alcohol to water
0:1 isopropyl alcohol to water 

11. 20 mL of 10% 
ammonia into a beaker 
12. Dip paper til marked line 
into beaker 
13. Wait for 10 minutes 
14. Remove chromatography strip 
15, Lie sample next to ruler
16. Measure distance 
solvent reached  
& distance food coloring reached 

Repeat steps 9 - 13 with:
3:1 ammonia to water ratio
1:1 ammonia to water ratio
1:3 ammonia to water ratio
0:1 ammonia to water ratio

17. Repeat both trials for 
a second-time
